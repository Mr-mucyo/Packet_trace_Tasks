Cisco Packet Tracer Network Configuration
This repository contains a series of network configuration experiments using Cisco Packet Tracer, designed to develop practical skills in configuring, testing, and troubleshooting small-scale networks. The project covers a variety of network setups, including home networks, basic network devices, wireless LANs, and VLANs.

Labs Overview
Lab 1: Small Home Network Configuration
Configured a basic home network with a router and two PCs.
Assigned static IP addresses and tested connectivity between PCs using ping commands.



Lab 2: Basic Network Devices Configuration
Set up a network topology with two routers, switches, and PCs.
Configured IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways.
Verified connectivity between routers and PCs and identified communication issues across subnets.



Lab 3: Configuring Wireless LANs
Configured a wireless network with WPA2-Personal security.
Connected a wireless client (PC3) and tested DHCP IP assignment.
Verified communication between wired and wireless devices.



Lab 4: Configuring Virtual LANs (VLANs)
Configured VLANs on switches and set up trunking for inter-VLAN communication.
Enabled inter-VLAN routing with subinterfaces on a router.
Tested connectivity within and across VLANs.



Technologies Used
Cisco Packet Tracer: Simulation tool for designing and testing network configurations.
Devices: Routers, switches, PCs, and wireless routers.
Protocols & Technologies: Static IP addressing, DHCP, WPA2-Personal security, VLANs, Routing, Trunking.
